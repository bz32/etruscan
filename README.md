# Etruscan

Etruscan is an Android app designed for efficient barcode scanning and tracking in a refile process. This app allows users to scan tray and item barcodes and save the results to a file for integration with their inventory management systems.

It was developed with a lot of help from AI.

## Features

- **Scan tray and item barcodes**: Capture tray and item data by scanning barcodes.
- **Barcode format validation**: Ensure that tray and item barcodes meet required formats:
    - **Tray barcode**: Two alpha characters followed by 5–6 numbers (e.g., `AB12345`).
    - **Item barcode**: Validates three formats — Codabar, Code 39, and 6-character alphanumeric.
- **Write to `refile.dat`**: Each scan generates an entry in a local file, which can be uploaded to an inventory system.
- **Scan count**: Track on-screen how many items have been scanned in the session.
